/// A Metric is a measure for cells. It is used to describe the shape and size
/// of cells. They are useful for deciding which cell level to use in order to
/// satisfy a given condition (e.g. that cell vertices must be no further than
/// "x" apart). You can use the Value(level) method to compute the corresponding
/// length or area on the unit sphere for cells at a given level. The minimum
/// and maximum bounds are valid for cells at all levels, but they may be
/// somewhat conservative for very large cells (e.g. face cells).
